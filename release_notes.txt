Release 0.020301

This is the initial release of ICL. ICL supercedes the Estimation Program for
Dichotomous Item Response Models (EPDIRM) by including estimation of models
for polytomous as well as dichotomous items. Some differences between
ICL and EPDIRM are described on the page 
http://www.b-a-h.com/software/irt/icl/epdirm_differences.html.

ICL fixes some bugs that existed in version 0.011118 of EPDIRM:

	Fixed a bug in read_examinee_missing command that prevented the command
	from working when the optional fifth and sixth arguments were used.
	[icl.tcl]

	Fixed a bug in the item_set_model command which caused the command 
	to not work and possibly crash the program. [swig_icl.cpp]

	Fixed a bug in the simulate_responses command
	that produced an error when simulate_responses was called.
	[swig_etirm.h, swig_etirm.cpp]
	
	Fixed a bug in which the examinee counts in each group were not
	updated in bootstrap_sample. [swig_etirm.h, swig_etirm.cpp]
